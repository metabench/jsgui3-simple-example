//   compared to a description of it.

// A container with reorderable internal draggable items could help.

// would be nice to be able to have all code in 1 file...???

// Relies on extracting CSS from JS files.

//  Ofc setting it up on the server first is important - then can that stage set it up in the doc sent to the client?

// Including the CSS from the JS like before.
//  Needs to extract the CSS and serve it as a separate CSS file.
//  Should also have end-to-end regression tests so this does not break again in the future.
//   The code was kind of clunky and got refactored away.

// Would need to parse the JS files to extract the CSS.
